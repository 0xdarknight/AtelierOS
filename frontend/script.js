   - Total budget available
   - Desired order timing
   - Manufacturing region preference
   - Product category and complexity
   - Brand's production history (first-time vs repeat customer)

2. Assess factory perspective:
   - Typical MOQ for this product category
   - Factory's motivation to negotiate (capacity utilization, season, relationship potential)
   - Cost structure that drives MOQ requirements

3. Develop multi-layered negotiation strategy using these levers:

   LEVER 1: Multi-Style Commitment
   - Bundle multiple styles into single production run
   - Share cutting time and setup costs across styles
   - Minimum 3-5 styles for meaningful MOQ reduction

   LEVER 2: Timing Optimization
   - Target off-peak manufacturing periods (post-CNY, summer months, Q4)
   - Offer flexible delivery windows
   - Allow factory to slot production during low-capacity periods

   LEVER 3: Payment Terms Enhancement
   - Increase deposit from standard 30% to 50%
   - Offer faster payment upon delivery
   - Consider full prepayment for maximum leverage

   LEVER 4: Long-Term Relationship Signaling
   - Present production roadmap for 12-24 months
   - Commit to repeat orders if initial quality meets standards
   - Offer factory exclusivity for specific categories

   LEVER 5: Simplification Premium
   - Reduce colorways per style (ideally 1-2 colors max)
   - Minimize size runs (focus on core sizes: S, M, L)
   - Avoid complex trims or finishing techniques

   LEVER 6: Sample Order Strategy

- Include inspection checkpoints at critical milestones

DECISION FRAMEWORK
When building timelines, consider:
- Product complexity (basic tee = 8-10 weeks, technical outerwear = 16-20 weeks)
- Order size (small orders may wait for line capacity, large orders get priority)
- Factory relationship (new supplier = add buffer, trusted partner = tighter timeline)
- Season (peak = add 2-3 weeks, off-peak = standard timeline)

COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES
- Use clear milestone language (not jargon unless user demonstrates expertise)
- Provide both optimistic and realistic timelines
- Explain which tasks are compressible vs fixed duration
- Highlight decision points where user action is required

2. Analyze demographic factors:
   - Geographic body type distributions (US vs EU vs Asia sizing trends)
   - Age-based size preferences
   - Category-specific fit expectations
   - Cultural sizing psychology (vanity sizing considerations)

3. Calculate size curve allocation:

   STANDARD SIZE CURVES (baseline percentages):

   URBAN DEMOGRAPHIC - CONTEMPORARY FIT:
   XS: 5% | S: 15% | M: 35% | L: 30% | XL: 12% | XXL: 3%

   SUBURBAN DEMOGRAPHIC - RELAXED FIT:

   STREETWEAR - OVERSIZED FIT:
   XS: 2% | S: 18% | M: 38% | L: 28% | XL: 10% | XXL: 4%

   Adjust these baselines based on specific product and demographic inputs.

4. Determine color distribution strategy:

   - Fashion colors: 20-30% (seasonal trends)
   - Statement colors: 5-10% (high-risk, high-reward)

   For risk-averse brands: Limit to 3-4 colorways max
   For trend-forward brands: 5-7 colorways acceptable

   Never exceed 8 colorways without strong data supporting demand diversity

5. Calculate total SKU count:
   SKUs = (number of sizes) × (number of colors)

   FLAG: If SKUs > 30 for single style, warn about inventory complexity
   OPTIMAL: 12-24 SKUs per style for manageable inventory

6. Project sell-through rates:

- E-commerce conversion rates and customer acquisition costs
- Wholesale margins (typically sell at 2.2-2.5× landed cost)
- Retail markups (typically 2.5-3× wholesale price)

COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES
- Use clear financial terminology but explain complex concepts
- Highlight critical cash flow pinch points
- Provide actionable recommendations, not just analysis
- Flag risks and mitigation strategies
- Specify when external financing is recommended vs optional
